# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational shell for the consumer-facing portal as a Progressive Web App (PWA). The shell provides basic navigation and page structure with three core pages (Home, Order, Profile) and responsive navigation. The implementation focuses on minimal viable functionality using mock data, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring responsive design for both web and mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to navigate between the main sections of the portal, so that I can access home, ordering, and profile functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive navigation menu
2. WHEN a user clicks on Home, Order, or Profile navigation items THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding page
3. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the navigation SHALL adapt to mobile-friendly patterns (hamburger menu or bottom navigation)
4. WHEN the application is viewed on desktop THEN the navigation SHALL display as a horizontal menu or sidebar

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to access a home page, so that I can see an overview of the portal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the home page THEN the system SHALL display a basic home page layout
2. WHEN the home page loads THEN the system SHALL show mock content appropriate for a consumer portal
3. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL be responsive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to access an order page, so that I can view ordering functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the order page THEN the system SHALL display a basic order page layout
2. WHEN the order page loads THEN the system SHALL show mock order data or placeholder content
3. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL be responsive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to access a profile page, so that I can view my account information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the profile page THEN the system SHALL display a basic profile page layout
2. WHEN the profile page loads THEN the system SHALL show mock user data or placeholder content
3. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL be responsive

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to receive feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in the application THEN the system SHALL display a basic error message
2. WHEN a user action is successful THEN the system SHALL optionally display a toast notification
3. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN they SHALL be user-friendly and not expose technical details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want the portal to work as a PWA, so that I can install it on my device and use it offline-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL meet basic PWA requirements (manifest, service worker)
2. WHEN a user visits the site on a supported browser THEN they SHALL see an install prompt option
3. WHEN the PWA is installed THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL be responsive across mobile and desktop viewports
