# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a consistent messaging system (toast notifications) that provides a unified way to display error, success, and informational messages to users across the application. The system will ensure all user feedback is delivered in a consistent, accessible, and user-friendly manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent messaging API, so that I can easily display notifications throughout the application without worrying about styling or positioning inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls the messaging API THEN the system SHALL provide methods for error, success, and info message types
2. WHEN a message is displayed THEN the system SHALL automatically handle positioning, styling, and timing
3. WHEN multiple messages are triggered THEN the system SHALL queue and display them appropriately
4. WHEN a message is created THEN the system SHALL accept a message string and optional configuration options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear visual feedback for my actions, so that I understand whether operations succeeded, failed, or need my attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a red-themed error message with appropriate iconography
2. WHEN an operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a green-themed success message with appropriate iconography
3. WHEN informational content needs to be shown THEN the system SHALL display a blue-themed info message with appropriate iconography
4. WHEN a message is displayed THEN the system SHALL auto-dismiss after a reasonable time period
5. WHEN a user clicks on a message THEN the system SHALL allow manual dismissal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want messages to be announced by screen readers, so that I can receive important feedback regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
2. WHEN an error message appears THEN the system SHALL use appropriate ARIA roles to indicate urgency
3. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient color contrast for visibility
4. WHEN messages contain interactive elements THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the messaging system easily, so that I can verify it works correctly during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a test interface or component
2. WHEN the test interface is used THEN the system SHALL allow triggering all message types (error, success, info)
3. WHEN integrated into the login page THEN the system SHALL provide test buttons for each message type
4. WHEN test messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL use sample content that demonstrates typical use cases

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want messages to appear in a consistent location and style, so that I can easily find and read important notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL position them in a consistent location (top-right or similar)
2. WHEN multiple messages are shown THEN the system SHALL stack them in a readable manner
3. WHEN messages appear THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography, spacing, and animation
4. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt message positioning for mobile and desktop views
5. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing UI elements or user interactions
