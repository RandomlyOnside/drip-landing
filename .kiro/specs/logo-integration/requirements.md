# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating the Local Drip logo into the website to replace the current text-based branding and enhance the visual identity. The logo will be implemented in two key locations: a small version in the header navigation to replace the "Local Drip" text, and a larger version in the hero section to strengthen brand presence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the Local Drip logo in the header navigation, so that I can easily identify the brand and have a more professional visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the system SHALL display a small Local Drip logo in the top-left corner of the header
2. WHEN a user views the header on desktop THEN the logo SHALL be appropriately sized (approximately 32-40px height) and maintain aspect ratio
3. WHEN a user views the header on mobile THEN the logo SHALL scale appropriately and remain visible alongside the mobile menu button
4. WHEN a user clicks on the header logo THEN the system SHALL scroll to the top of the page or navigate to the home page
5. IF the logo fails to load THEN the system SHALL display "Local Drip" text as a fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see a prominent Local Drip logo in the hero section, so that I have a strong visual connection to the brand when I first visit the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a large Local Drip logo prominently in the hero section
2. WHEN a user views the hero section THEN the logo SHALL be positioned above or integrated with the main headline
3. WHEN a user views the hero on different screen sizes THEN the logo SHALL scale responsively (approximately 120-200px height on desktop, 80-120px on mobile)
4. WHEN the hero logo is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain proper contrast against the background
5. IF the hero logo fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logo assets to be properly organized and optimized, so that the website loads efficiently and the assets are maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logo assets are added to the project THEN they SHALL be stored in the appropriate Next.js public directory structure
2. WHEN logos are implemented THEN they SHALL be optimized for web (appropriate file size and format)
3. WHEN logos are used in components THEN they SHALL use Next.js Image component for optimization
4. WHEN logos are displayed THEN they SHALL include proper alt text for accessibility
5. WHEN logos are implemented THEN they SHALL support both light and dark themes if applicable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable logo component framework, so that I can easily implement the Local Drip logo anywhere in the application with consistent styling and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing logos THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable Logo component with configurable size variants
2. WHEN using the Logo component THEN it SHALL accept props for size (small, medium, large, custom), variant (header, hero, footer, inline), and interactive behavior
3. WHEN the Logo component is used THEN it SHALL automatically apply appropriate styling based on the variant and context
4. WHEN developers need to add logos elsewhere THEN they SHALL be able to import and use the Logo component with minimal configuration
5. WHEN the Logo component is used THEN it SHALL maintain consistent behavior (accessibility, fallbacks, optimization) across all instances

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the logos to be properly accessible, so that I can understand the brand identity regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logos are displayed THEN they SHALL include descriptive alt text
2. WHEN logos are interactive (clickable) THEN they SHALL be keyboard accessible
3. WHEN logos are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios
4. WHEN logos fail to load THEN screen readers SHALL announce the fallback text appropriately
5. WHEN logos are focused THEN they SHALL display visible focus indicators
