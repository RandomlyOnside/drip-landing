# Logo Assets

This directory contains the Local Drip logo assets in various formats and sizes.

## Current Files

- `ld-official.png` - Original logo file (1000x500px, 22KB)
- `logo.png` - Primary logo file (currently copy of original)
- `logo-small.png` - Small variant for header use (currently copy of original)
- `logo-large.png` - Large variant for hero section (currently copy of original)
- `logo.svg` - SVG placeholder (needs to be replaced with actual vector logo)

## Optimization Status

⚠️ **Optimization Needed**: The current PNG files are copies of the original and need to be optimized:

### Recommended Optimizations

1. **logo-small.png**: Should be resized to 128x64px (2x for retina) for header use
2. **logo-large.png**: Should be resized to 800x400px (2x for retina) for hero section
3. **logo.svg**: Should be replaced with actual vector version of the logo
4. **Compression**: All PNG files should be compressed for web delivery

### Usage Guidelines

- Use `logo.svg` as primary format when possible for scalability
- Use `logo-small.png` for header navigation (32-40px display height)
- Use `logo-large.png` for hero section (120-200px display height)
- Use `logo.png` as general fallback

## Next Steps

1. Create proper SVG version from original design files
2. Resize PNG variants to appropriate dimensions
3. Compress all images for web optimization
4. Test loading performance and visual quality
